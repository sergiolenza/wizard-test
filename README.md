# wizard-test 🎉

This is my proposal for a technical test for a client.

The project is about making a multi-form wizard from scratch, using custom components, using HTML semantic tags, handling response asynchrony, using best practices, styling methodologies, i18n and performance.

I have only used 2 external dependencies apart from the ones already given.

- [check-password-strength](https://github.com/deanilvincent/check-password-strength), which is a package that exports a function to return the strength of a password in values from 0 to 3.
- [lodash.debounce](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash.debounce) which is the lodash debounce function that helps me to avoid overloading a component with calls.
